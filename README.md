# CNN_RL_Enduro
This is a CNN model that with help of reinforcement learning and deepQlearning manages, too make the car in enduro drive fast on the track and identify other cars and overtake them.
In the pacman project the goal was to make an AI that could find it's way around in a maze and get away from the ghosts, the goal here is to learn the ai too drive fast on a road defined by two lines, also it must learn how to identify other cars and learn how to overtake other cars. This ai succeeded in that task, after two million steps of training. This was a model that took double the amount of training too be succesfull in comparison to the Pacman ai. But the reason for this is obvious if you take a look at it's wheights after a million steps. The AI starts of very slow, and drives into the side of the road, this means that it never overtakes any cars. Thats a problem beacuse what it gets a reward from is overtaking, so it never gets better beacuse it never achieves anything, but then around 1.5 million steps it tries too overtake one car, and then it learns the game exponentially fast.
